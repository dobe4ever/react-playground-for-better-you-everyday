No, you don't have to run the build and deployment process every time you make updates to your app on GitHub Pages. You can automate this process using GitHub Actions, which allows you to set up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. This way, your app will automatically build and deploy whenever you push changes to your repository.

Here's how you can set up GitHub Actions to automate the build and deployment process for your React app on GitHub Pages:

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Actions Workflow

1. In your repository, create a new directory called `.github/workflows`.
2. Inside the `workflows` directory, create a new file called `deploy.yml`.

### Step 2: Define the GitHub Actions Workflow

Add the following content to the `deploy.yml` file:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Set this to the branch you want to deploy from

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'  # You can specify the Node.js version you are using

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Build the project
      run: npm run build

    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        publish_dir: ./build
```

### Step 3: Commit and Push the Workflow File

1. Commit the `deploy.yml` file to your repository.
2. Push the changes to the `main` branch (or the branch you specified in the workflow).

### Step 4: Verify the Deployment

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository.
2. You should see a new workflow run for the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" action.
3. Click on the workflow run to see the details and ensure that the build and deployment steps are successful.

### Step 5: Access Your Deployed Site

Once the workflow completes successfully, your React app should be deployed to GitHub Pages. You can access your deployed site at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>`.

### Additional Notes

- **Environment Variables**: If your build process requires environment variables, you can add them to your GitHub repository's secrets.
- **Custom Domain**: If you want to use a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site, you can configure it in the repository settings.
- **Branch Configuration**: Make sure the branch specified in the workflow (`main` in this example) is the branch you want to deploy from.

By setting up this GitHub Actions workflow, your React app will automatically build and deploy to GitHub Pages whenever you push changes to the specified branch. This saves you the hassle of manually running the build and deployment process every time you make updates.
